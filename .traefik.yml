summary: |
  Traefik XRealIP Fixer inspects Cloudflare headers, Cloudfront headers, and the full
  X-Forwarded-For chain (indexing from the end) to determine the first trustworthy public IP.
  It then writes X-Real-IP with that verified address so downstream services can rely on it for
  logging, rate limiting, and security decisions.
testData:
  trustCloudflare: true
  trustXForwardedFor: true
